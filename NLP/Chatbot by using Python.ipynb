Le2, Ruslan Salakhutdinov1\\n1Carnegie Mellon University,2Google Brain\\n{dzihang,zhiliny,yiming,jgc,rsalakhu}@cs.cmu.edu, qvl@google.com\\nAbstract\\nTransformers have a potential of learning\\nlonger-term dependency, but are limited by a\\nﬁxed-length context in the setting of language\\nmodeling. We propose a novel neural ar-\\nchitecture Transformer-XL that enables learn-\\ning dependency beyond a ﬁxed length with-\\nout disrupting temporal coherence. It con-\\nsists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism\\nand a novel positional encoding scheme. Our\\nmethod not only enables capturing longer-term\\ndependency, but also resolves the context frag-\\nmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-\\nXL learns dependency that is 80% longer than\\nRNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Trans-\\nformers, achieves better performance on both\\nshort and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+\\ntimes faster than vanilla Transformers during\\nevaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-\\nthe-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on en-\\nwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103,\\n21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn\\nTreebank (without ﬁnetuning). When trained\\nonly on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL man-\\nages to generate reasonably coherent, novel\\ntext articles with thousands of tokens. Our\\ncode, pretrained models, and hyperparameters\\nare available in both Tensorﬂow and PyTorch1.\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage modeling is among the important prob-\\nlems that require modeling long-term dependency,\\nwith successful applications such as unsupervised\\npretraining (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al., 2018;\\nRadford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018). How-\\never, it has been a challenge to equip neural\\nnetworks with the capability to model long-term\\ndependency in sequential data. Recurrent neu-\\nral networks (RNNs), in particular Long Short-\\n\\x03Equal contribution. Order determined by swapping the\\none in Yang et al. (2017).\\n1https://github.com/kimiyoung/\\ntransformer-xlTerm Memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter and\\nSchmidhuber, 1997), have been a standard solu-\\ntion to language modeling and obtained strong\\nresults on multiple benchmarks. Despite the\\nwide adaption, RNNs are difﬁcult to optimize\\ndue to gradient vanishing and explosion (Hochre-\\niter et al., 2001), and the introduction of gat-\\ning in LSTMs and the gradient clipping tech-\\nnique (Graves, 2013) might not be sufﬁcient to\\nfully address this issue. Empirically, previous\\nwork has found that LSTM language models use\\n200 context words on average (Khandelwal et al.,\\n2018), indicating room for further improvement.\\nOn the other hand, the direct connections be-\\ntween long-distance word pairs baked in atten-\\ntion mechanisms might ease optimization and en-\\nable the learning of long-term dependency (Bah-\\ndanau et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017). Re-\\ncently, Al-Rfou et al. (2018) designed a set of aux-\\niliary losses to train deep Transformer networks\\nfor character-level language modeling, which out-\\nperform LSTMs by a large margin. Despite the\\nsuccess, the LM training in Al-Rfou et al. (2018)\\nis performed on separated ﬁxed-length segments\\nof a few hundred characters, without any informa-\\ntion ﬂow across segments. As a consequence of\\nthe ﬁxed context length, the model cannot capture\\nany longer-term dependency beyond the prede-\\nﬁned context length. In addition, the ﬁxed-length\\nsegments are created by selecting a consecutive\\nchunk of symbols without respecting the sentence\\nor any other semantic boundary. Hence, the model\\nlacks necessary contextual information needed to\\nwell predict the ﬁrst few symbols, leading to inef-\\nﬁcient optimization and inferior performance. We\\nrefer to this problem as context fragmentation .\\nTo address the aforementioned limitations of\\nﬁxed-length contexts, we propose a new architec-\\nture called Transformer-XL (meaning extra long).\\nWe introduce the notion of recurrence into ourarXiv:1901.02860v3  [cs.LG]  2 Jun 2019deep self-attention network. In particular, instead\\nof computing the hidden states from scratch for\\neach new segment, we reuse the hidden states ob-\\ntained in previous segments. The reused hidden\\nstates serve as memory for the current segment,\\nwhich builds up a recurrent connection between\\nthe segments. As a result, modeling very long-\\nterm dependency becomes possible because in-\\nformation can be propagated through the recur-\\nrent connections. Meanwhile, passing informa-\\ntion from the previous segment can also resolve\\nthe problem of context fragmentation. More im-\\nportantly, we show the necessity of using relative\\npositional encodings rather than absolute ones, in\\norder to enable state reuse without causing tem-\\nporal confusion. Hence, as an additional techni-\\ncal contribution, we introduce a simple but more\\neffective relative positional encoding formulation\\nthat generalizes to attention lengths longer than the\\none observed during training.\\nTransformer-XL obtained strong results on ﬁve\\ndatasets, varying from word-level to character-\\nlevel language modeling. Transformer-XL is also\\nable to generate relatively coherent long text arti-\\ncles with thousands of tokens (see Appendix E),\\ntrained on only 100M tokens.\\nOur main technical contributions include intro-\\nducing the notion of recurrence in a purely self-\\nattentive model and deriving a novel positional en-\\ncoding scheme. These two techniques form a com-\\nplete set of solutions, as any one of them alone\\ndoes not address the issue of ﬁxed-length con-\\ntexts. Transformer-XL is the ﬁrst self-attention\\nmodel that achieves substantially better results\\nthan RNNs on both character-level and word-level\\nlanguage modeling.\\n2 Related Work\\nIn the last few years, the ﬁeld of language mod-\\neling has witnessed many signiﬁcant advances,\\nincluding but not limited to devising novel ar-\\nchitectures to better encode the context (Bengio\\net al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2010; Merity et al.,\\n2016; Al-Rfou et al., 2018), improving regulariza-\\ntion and optimization algorithms (Gal and Ghahra-\\nmani, 2016) , speeding up the Softmax computa-\\ntion (Grave et al., 2016a) , and enriching the output\\ndistribution family (Yang et al., 2017).\\nTo capture the long-range context in language\\nmodeling, a line of work directly feeds a repre-\\nsentation of the wider context into the networkas an additional input. Existing works range\\nfrom ones where context representations are man-\\nually deﬁned (Mikolov and Zweig, 2012; Ji et al.,\\n2015; Wang and Cho, 2015) to others that rely on\\ndocument-level topics learned from data (Dieng\\net al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017).\\nMore broadly, in generic sequence modeling,\\nhow to capture long-term dependency has been a\\nlong-standing research problem. From this per-\\nspective, since the ubiquitous adaption of LSTM,\\nmany efforts have been spent on relieving the\\nvanishing gradient problem, including better ini-\\ntialization (Le et al., 2015), additional loss sig-\\nnal (Trinh et al., 2018), augmented memory struc-\\nture (Ke et al., 2018) and others that modify the in-\\nternal architecture of RNNs to ease the optimiza-\\ntion (Wu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018). Different\\nfrom them, our work is based on the Transformer\\narchitecture and shows that language modeling as\\na real-world task beneﬁts from the ability to learn\\nlonger-term dependency.\\n3 Model\\nGiven a corpus of tokens x= (x1;:::;xT), the\\ntask of language modeling is to estimate the joint\\nprobabilityP(x), which is often auto-regressively\\nfactorized as P(x) =Q\\ntP(xtjx<t). With the\\nfactorization, the problem reduces to estimating\\neach conditional factor. In this work, we stick to\\nthe standard neural approach to modeling the con-\\nditional probability. Speciﬁcally, a trainable neu-\\nral network is used to encode the context x<tinto\\na ﬁxed size hidden state, which is multiplied with\\nthe word embeddings to obtain the logits. The log-\\nits are then fed into the Softmax function, yielding\\na categorical probability distribution over the next\\ntoken.\\n3.1 Vanilla Transformer Language Models\\nIn order to apply Transformer or self-attention to\\nlanguage modeling, the central problem is how to\\ntrain a Transformer to effectively encode an arbi-\\ntrarily long context into a ﬁxed size representation.\\nGiven inﬁnite memory and computation, a sim-\\nple solution would be to process the entire con-\\ntext sequence using an unconditional Transformer\\ndecoder, similar to a feed-forward neural network.\\nHowever, this is usually infeasible with the limited\\nresource in practice.\\nOne feasible but crude approximation is to split\\nthe entire corpus into shorter segments of man-Segment 1x1x2x4x3Segment 2x8x5x6x7(a) Train phase.\\nLimited Contextx1x2x4x3x5x6\\nLimited Contextx2x3x5x4x6x1\\nLimited Contextx3x4x6x5x2\\nx1 (b) Evaluation phase.\\nFigure 1: Illustration of the vanilla model with a segment length 4.\\nageable sizes, and only train the model within\\neach segment, ignoring all contextual information\\nfrom previous segments. This is the idea adopted\\nby Al-Rfou et al. (2018). We call it the vanilla\\nmodel and visualize it in Fig. 1a. Under this\\ntraining paradigm, information never ﬂows across\\nsegments in either the forward or backward pass.\\nThere are two critical limitations of using a ﬁxed-\\nlength context. First, the largest possible depen-\\ndency length is upper bounded by the segment\\nlength, which is a few hundred on character-level\\nlanguage modeling (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). There-\\nfore, although the self-attention mechanism is less\\naffected by the vanishing gradient problem com-\\npared to RNNs, the vanilla model is not able to\\nfully exploit this optimization advantage. Second,\\nthough it is possible to use padding to respect the\\nsentence or other semantic boundaries, in practice\\nit has been standard practice to simply chunk long\\ntext into ﬁxed-length segments due to improved\\nefﬁciency (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018;\\nAl-Rfou et al., 2018). However, simply chunking\\na sequence into ﬁxed-length segments will lead to\\nthe context fragmentation problem as discussed in\\nSection 1.\\nDuring evaluation, at each step, the vanilla\\nmodel also consumes a segment of the same length\\nas in training, but only makes one prediction at the\\nlast position. Then, at the next step, the segment\\nis shifted to the right by only one position, and the\\nnew segment has to be processed all from scratch.\\nAs shown in Fig. 1b, this procedure ensures that\\neach prediction utilizes the longest possible con-\\ntext exposed during training, and also relieves con-\\ntext fragmentation issue encountered in training.\\nHowever, this evaluation procedure is extremely\\nexpensive. We will show that our proposed archi-\\ntecture is able to substantially improve the evalua-\\ntion speed.3.2 Segment-Level Recurrence with State\\nReuse\\nTo address the limitations of using a ﬁxed-length\\ncontext, we propose to introduce a recurrence\\nmechanism to the Transformer architecture. Dur-\\ning training, the hidden state sequence computed\\nfor the previous segment is ﬁxed andcached to\\nbe reused as an extended context when the model\\nprocesses the next new segment, as shown in Fig.\\n2a. Although the gradient still remains within a\\nsegment, this additional input allows the network\\nto exploit information in the history, leading to an\\nability of modeling longer-term dependency and\\navoiding context fragmentation. Formally, let the\\ntwo consecutive segments of length Lbes\\x1c=\\n[x\\x1c;1;\\x01\\x01\\x01;x\\x1c;L]ands\\x1c+1= [x\\x1c+1;1;\\x01\\x01\\x01;x\\x1c+1;L]\\nrespectively.

As a result, the effective context be-\\ning utilized can go way beyond just two segments.\\nHowever, notice that the recurrent dependency be-\\ntween hn\\n\\x1c+1andhn\\x001\\n\\x1cshifts one layer downwardsx1x2x4x3x8x5x6x7New Segmentx12x9x10x11Fixed (No Grad)x1x2x4x3x8x5x6x7Fixed (No Grad)New Segment(a) Training phase.\\nx1x2x4x3x8x5x6x7x12x9x10x11Extended Context (b) Evaluation phase.\\nFigure 2: Illustration of the Transformer-XL model with a segment length 4.\\nper-segment, which differs from the same-layer\\nrecurrence in conventional RNN-LMs. Conse-\\nquently, the largest possible dependency length\\ngrows linearly w.r.t. the number of layers as well\\nas the segment length, i.e., O(N\\x02L), as vi-\\nsualized by the shaded area in Fig. 2b. This\\nis analogous to truncated BPTT (Mikolov et al.,\\n2010), a technique developed for training RNN-\\nLMs. However, different from truncated BPTT,\\nour method caches a sequence of hidden states in-\\nstead of the last one, and should be applied to-\\ngether with the relative positional encoding tech-\\nnique described in Section 3.3.\\nBesides achieving extra long context and re-\\nsolving fragmentation, another beneﬁt that comes\\nwith the recurrence scheme is signiﬁcantly faster\\nevaluation. Speciﬁcally, during evaluation, the\\nrepresentations from the previous segments can\\nbe reused instead of being computed from scratch\\nas in the case of the vanilla model. In our ex-\\nperiments on enwiki8, Transformer-XL is up to\\n1,800+ times faster than the vanilla model during\\nevaluation (see Section 4).\\nFinally, notice that the recurrence scheme does\\nnot need to be restricted to only the previous seg-\\nment. In theory, we can cache as many previous\\nsegments as the GPU memory allows, and reuse\\nall of them as the extra context when processing\\nthe current segment. Thus, we can cache a prede-\\nﬁned length- Mold hidden states spanning (pos-\\nsibly) multiple segments, and refer to them as the\\nmemory mn\\n\\x1c2RM\\x02d, due to a clear connection to\\nthe memory augmented neural networks (Graves\\net al., 2014; Weston et al., 2014). In our experi-\\nments, we set Mequal to the segment length dur-\\ning training, and increase it by multiple times dur-\\ning evaluation.\\n3.3 Relative Positional Encodings\\nWhile we found the idea presented in the pre-\\nvious subsection very appealing, there is a cru-\\ncial technical challenge we haven’t solved in or-der to reuse the hidden states. That is, how can\\nwe keep the positional information coherent when\\nwe reuse the states? Recall that, in the standard\\nTransformer, the information of sequence order is\\nprovided by a set of positional encodings, denoted\\nasU2RLmax\\x02d, where the i-th row Uicorre-\\nsponds to the i-thabsolute position within a seg-\\nment andLmaxprescribes the maximum possible\\nlength to be modeled. Then, the actual input to the\\nTransformer is the element-wise addition of the\\nword embeddings and the positional encodings. If\\nwe simply adapt this positional encoding to our\\nrecurrence mechanism, the hidden state sequence\\nwould be computed schematically by\\nh\\x1c+1=f(h\\x1c;Es\\x1c+1+U1:L)\\nh\\x1c=f(h\\x1c\\x001;Es\\x1c+U1:L);\\nwhere Es\\x1c2RL\\x02dis the word embedding se-\\nquence of s\\x1c, andfrepresents a transformation\\nfunction. Notice that, both Es\\x1candEs\\x1c+1are as-\\nsociated with the same positional encoding U1:L.\\nAs a result, the model has no information to dis-\\ntinguish the positional difference between x\\x1c;jand\\nx\\x1c+1;jfor anyj= 1;:::;L , resulting in a sheer\\nperformance loss.\\nIn order to avoid this failure mode, the funda-\\nmental idea is to only encode the relative posi-\\ntional information in the hidden states. Concep-\\ntually, the positional encoding gives the model a\\ntemporal clue or “bias” about how information\\nshould be gathered, i.e., where to attend. For the\\nsame purpose, instead of incorporating bias stati-\\ncally into the initial embedding, one can inject the\\nsame information into the attention score of each\\nlayer. More importantly, it is more intuitive and\\ngeneralizable to deﬁne the temporal bias in a rela-\\ntive manner. For instance, when a query vector q\\x1c;i\\nattends on the key vectors k\\x1c;\\x14i, it does not need\\nto know the absolute position of each key vector\\nto identify the temporal order of the segment. In-\\nstead, it sufﬁces to know the relative distance be-\\ntween each key vector k\\x1c;jand itselfq\\x1c;i, i.e.i\\x00j.\\nPractically, one can create a set of relative posi-tional encodings R2RLmax\\x02d, where thei-th row\\nRiindicates a relative distance of ibetween two\\npositions. By injecting the relative distance dy-\\nnamically into the attention score, the query vector\\ncan easily distinguish the representations of x\\x1c;j\\nandx\\x1c+1;jfrom their different distances, making\\nthe state reuse mechanism feasible. Meanwhile,\\nwe won’t lose any temporal information, as the ab-\\nsolute position can be recovered recursively from\\nrelative distances.\\nPreviously, the idea of relative positional encod-\\nings has been explored in the context of machine\\ntranslation (Shaw et al., 2018) and music gener-\\nation (Huang et al., 2018). Here, we offer a dif-\\nferent derivation, arriving at a new form of rel-\\native positional encodings, which not only has a\\none-to-one correspondence to its absolute coun-\\nterpart but also enjoys much better generalization\\nempirically (see Section 4). Firstly, in the standard\\nTransformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), the attention\\nscore between query qiand key vector kjwithin\\nthe same segment can be decomposed as\\nAabs\\ni;j=E>\\nxiW>\\nqWkExj|{z}\\n(a)+E>\\nxiW>\\nqWkUj|{z}\\n(b)\\n+U>\\niW>\\nqWkExj|{z}\\n(c)+U>\\niW>\\nqWkUj|{z}\\n(d):\\nFollowing the idea of only relying on rela-\\ntive positional information, we propose to re-\\nparameterize the four terms as follows\\nArel\\ni;j=E>\\nxiW>\\nqWk;EExj|{z}\\n(a)+E>\\nxiW>\\nqWk;RRi\\x00j|{z}\\n(b)\\n+u>Wk;EExj|{z}\\n(c)+v>Wk;RRi\\x00j|{z}\\n(d):\\n\\x0fThe ﬁrst change we make is to replace all ap-\\npearances of the absolute positional embedding\\nUjfor computing key vectors in term (b)and\\n(d)with its relative counterpart Ri\\x00j. This es-\\nsentially reﬂects the prior that only the relative\\ndistance matters for where to attend. Note that\\nRis a sinusoid encoding matrix (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017) without learnable parameters.\\n\\x0fSecondly, we introduce a trainable parameter\\nu2Rdto replace the query U>\\niW>\\nqin term\\n(c). In this case, since the query vector is the\\nsame for all query positions, it suggests that the\\nattentive bias towards different words should re-\\nmain the same regardless of the query position.\\nWith a similar reasoning, a trainable parameter\\nv2Rdis added to substitute U>\\niW>\\nqin term\\n(d).\\x0fFinally, we deliberately separate the two weight\\nmatrices Wk;EandWk;Rfor producing the\\ncontent-based key vectors and location-based\\nkey vectors respectively.\\nUnder the new parameterization, each term has\\nan intuitive meaning: term (a)represents content-\\nbased addressing, term (b)captures a content-\\ndependent positional bias, term (c)governs a\\nglobal content bias, and (d)encodes a global po-\\nsitional bias.\\nIn comparison, the formulation in Shaw et al.\\n(2018) only has terms (a)and(b), dropping the\\ntwo bias terms (c)and(d). Moreover, Shaw et al.\\n(2018) merge the multiplication WkRinto a sin-\\ngle trainable matrix ^R, which abandons the induc-\\ntive bias built into the original sinusoid positional\\nencoding (Vaswani et al., 2017). In contrast, our\\nrelative positional embedding Radapts the sinu-\\nsoid formulation. As a beneﬁt of the inductive\\nbias, a model trained on a memory of some certain\\nlength can automatically generalize to a memory\\nseveral times longer during evaluation.\\nEquipping the recurrence mechanism with our\\nproposed relative positional embedding, we ﬁnally\\narrive at the Transformer-XL architecture. For\\ncompleteness, we summarize the computational\\nprocedure for a N-layer Transformer-XL with a\\nsingle attention head here.

In addition, it is worth mention-\\ning that a naive way to compute Arequires com-\\nputing Wn\\nk;RRi\\x00jfor all pairs (i;j), whose cost\\nis quadratic w.r.t. the sequence length. How-\\never, noticing that the value of i\\x00jonly ranges\\nfrom zero to the sequence length, we show a sim-\\nple computation procedure in Appendix B, which\\nreduces the cost to be linear w.r.t. the sequence\\nlength.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Main Results\\nWe apply Transformer-XL to a variety of datasets\\non both word-level and character-level languageModel #Param PPL\\nGrave et al.

Consequently, this dataset mainly tests\\nthe ability of modeling only short-term depen-\\ndency. The comparison between Transformer-XL\\nand the other methods is shown in Table 4. Al-\\nthough Transformer-XL is mainly designed to bet-\\nter capture longer-term dependency, it dramati-\\ncally improves the single-model SoTA from 23.7\\nto 21.8. Speciﬁcally, Transformer-XL signiﬁ-\\ncantly outperforms a contemporary method using\\nvanilla Transformers (Baevski and Auli, 2018),\\nsuggesting the advantage of Transformer-XL is\\ngeneralizable to modeling short sequences.\\nWe also report the results on word-level Penn\\nTreebank in Table 5. Similar to AWD-LSTM\\n(Merity et al., 2017), we apply variational dropout\\nand weight average to Transformer-XL. With\\nproper regularization, Transformer-XL achieves a\\nnew SoTA result among models without two-step\\nﬁnetuning. Penn Treebank has only 1M training\\ntokens, which implies that Transformer-XL also\\ngeneralizes well even on small datasets.\\n4.2 Ablation Study\\nWe conduct two sets of ablation studies to exam-\\nine the effects of two proposed techniques used in\\nTransformer-XL: the recurrence mechanism and\\nthe new positional encoding scheme.\\nThe ﬁrst study is performed on WikiText-103,\\nwhich requires modeling long-term dependency.\\nThe results are reported in Table 6. Among the\\ncompared encoding schemes, Shaw et al. (2018) is\\nrelative, while Vaswani et al. (2017) and Al-Rfou\\net al. (2018) are absolute. “Full” and “half” losses\\nrefer to applying a cross entropy loss to all or the\\nrecent half positions in the segment. We foundthat absolute encodings only work well with half\\nlosses because half losses exclude positions with\\nvery short attention lengths during training for bet-\\nter generalization. Table 6 shows that both the\\nrecurrence mechanism and our encoding scheme\\nare necessary to achieve the best performance, as\\nwell as generalizing to longer attention sequences\\nduring evaluation time. Although the backprop-\\nagation length during training is only 128, with\\nthe two techniques the attention length can be in-\\ncreased to 640 at test time. In the standard setting\\nwith 151M parameters, the perplexity decreases as\\nthe attention length increases.\\nSince the recurrence mechanism costs addi-\\ntional memory, we also compare Transformer-XL\\nwith baselines under the same GPU memory con-\\nstraints. As shown in Table 10 in Appendix A,\\ndespite using a shorter backpropagation length,\\nTransformer-XL remains superior to the baselines.\\nThe second study targets at isolating the ef-\\nfects of resolving the context fragmentation prob-\\nlem from the beneﬁt of capturing longer context\\nlength. In order to achieve this goal, we deliber-\\nately choose a dataset that does not require long-\\nterm dependency, so that any improvement from\\nestablishing the recurrence can be attributed to\\nsolving the context fragmentation. Speciﬁcally,\\nwe perform this controlled experiment on the One\\nBillion Word dataset, which can only beneﬁt from\\nremoving the context fragmentation. We train\\na 20-layer Transformer-XL with \\x180.3B parame-\\nters for 400K steps. As shown in Table 7, using\\nsegment-level recurrence substantially improves\\nperformance even when long-term dependency is\\nnot needed, which is consistent with our previous\\ndiscussion that the recurrence mechanism resolves\\nthe context fragmentation problem. Moreover, our\\nrelative positional encodings is also superior to\\nShaw et al. (2018) on short sequences.\\n4.3 Relative Effective Context Length\\nKhandelwal et al. (2018) proposed a method to\\nevaluate the Effective Context Length (ECL) of a\\nsequence model. ECL is the longest length to\\nwhich increasing the context span would lead to\\na gain more than a threshold. However, ECL ig-\\nnores the fact that it is harder to get improve-\\nment when a model already achieves a lower per-\\nplexity using only a shorter context, and thus it\\nis not suitable for fair comparison among mul-\\ntiple models.

Both the re-\\ncurrence mechanism and our positional encodings\\ncontribute to a longer RECL. This further substan-\\ntiates our argument that Transformer-XL is able to\\nmodel longer-term dependency.\\n4.4 Generated Text\\nTrained only on WikiText-103 which is medium-\\nsized, Transformer-XL is already able to generate\\nrelatively coherent articles with thousands of to-\\nkens without manual cherry picking, despite mi-\\nnor ﬂaws. Please refer to Appendix E for samples.\\n4.5 Evaluation Speed\\nFinally, we compare the evaluation speed of our\\nmodel with the vanilla Transformer model (Al-\\nRfou et al., 2018). As shown in Table 9, due to\\nthe state reuse scheme, Transformer-XL achieves\\nan up to 1,874 times speedup during evaluation.5 Conclusions\\nTransformer-XL obtains strong perplexity results,\\nmodels longer-term dependency than RNNs and\\nTransformer, achieves substantial speedup during\\nevaluation, and is able to generate coherent text\\narticles. We envision interesting applications of\\nTransformer-XL in the ﬁelds of text generation,\\nunsupervised feature learning, image and speech\\nmodeling.\\nAcknowledgments\\nZD and YY were supported in part by National\\nScience Foundation (NSF) under the grant IIS-\\n1546329 and by the DOE-Ofﬁce of Science un-\\nder the grant ASCR #KJ040201.

Here, we present a simple method with only a linear cost. Firstly, notice that the\\nrelative distance i\\x00jcan only be integer from 0 to M+L\\x001, whereMandLare the memory length\\nand segment length respectively. Hence, the rows of the matrix\\nQ:=2\\n6664R>\\nM+L\\x001\\nR>\\nM+L\\x002\\n...\\nR>\\n1\\nR>\\n03\\n7775Wk;R>=2\\n6664[Wk;RRM+L\\x001]>\\n[Wk;RRM+L\\x002]>\\n...\\n[Wk;RR1]>\\n[Wk;RR0]>3\\n77752R(M+L)\\x02d\\nconsist of all possible vector outputs of Wk;RRi\\x00jfor any (i;j). Note that we have deﬁned Qin a\\nreversed order, i.e., Qk=Wk;RRM+L\\x001\\x00k, to make further discussion easier.\\nNext, we collect the term (b)for all possible i;jinto the following L\\x02(M+L)matrix,\\nB=2\\n6664q>\\n0Wk;RRM\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\n0Wk;RR0 0\\x01\\x01\\x01 0\\nq>\\n1Wk;RRM+1\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\n1Wk;RR1q>\\n1Wk;RR0\\x01\\x01\\x01 0\\n..................\\nq>\\nL\\x001Wk;RRM+L\\x001\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\nL\\x001Wk;RRM+L\\x001q>\\nL\\x001Wk;RRL\\x001\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\nL\\x001Wk;RR03\\n7775\\n=2\\n6664q>\\n0QL\\x001\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\n0QM+L\\x001 0\\x01\\x01\\x01 0\\nq>\\n1QL\\x002\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\n1QM+L\\x002q>\\n1QM+L\\x001\\x01\\x01\\x01 0\\n..................\\nq>\\nL\\x001Q0\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\nL\\x001QMq>\\nL\\x001QM+1\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\nL\\x001QM+L\\x0013\\n7775\\nThen, we further deﬁne\\neB=qQ>=2\\n6664q>\\n0Q0\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\n0QMq>\\n0QM+1\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\n0QM+L\\x001\\nq>\\n1Q0\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\n1QMq>\\n1QM+1\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\n1QM+L\\x001\\n..................\\nq>\\nL\\x001Q0\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\nL\\x001QMq>\\nL\\x001QM+1\\x01\\x01\\x01q>\\nL\\x001QM+L\\x0013\\n7775:\\nNow, it is easy to see an immediate relationship between BandeB, where thei-th row of Bis simply a\\nleft-shifted version of i-th row ofeB.

Let M=fm1;m2;\\x01\\x01\\x01;mNgbe a model\\ngroup consisting of Nmodels. Let li(c;t)denote the loss of model mion thet-th token in the corpus\\nwith a context length c. Concretely, the loss can be written as\\nli(c;t) =\\x00logPmi(xtjxt\\x001;\\x01\\x01\\x01;xt\\x00c)\\nwherePmiis the probability distribution given by model mi, andxtis thet-th token in the corpus. Given\\na short context length cand a long context length c0such thatc0\\x15c, we can further deﬁne a baseline for\\neach position t,\\nb(c;t) =N\\nmin\\ni=1li(c;t)\\nTherelative loss ofmiw.r.t. the model group Mis written as\\nfi(c;c0) =1\\njTjX\\nt2Tmin\\x00\\nb(c;t);li(c0;t)\\x01\\nThe above equation uses the minimum loss of all models on the short length cas a baseline, and only\\nlosses smaller than the baseline will be effectively counted towards the relative loss. This enables faircomparison between multiple models because all models with a long context length c0need to improve\\nover the same baseline. Sometimes we only care about those positions where the baseline performs\\npoorly (which means short-term dependency with context length cis not sufﬁcient), so given a ratio\\nparameterr, we deﬁne the setTis the above equation as\\nT=top-rpositionstwith largest b(c;t)\\nTherelative gain is subsequently deﬁned as the relative perplexity reduction:\\ngi(c;c0) =expfi(c;c)\\x00expfi(c;c0)\\nexpfi(c;c)\\nGiven a step size \\x01, we then use an algorithm to ﬁnd the RECL by thresholding the relative gain:\\n1. Set initial short context length c, and long context length c0=c+ \\x01\\n2. Compute gi(c;c0). Ifgi(c;c0)<0:01, return RECL =c. Ifgi(c;c0)\\x150:01, setc=c0;c0=c+ \\x01\\nand go to step 1.\\nIn Figure 3, we visualize the unnormalized relative perplexity gains (expfi(c;c)\\x00expfi(c;c0))with\\nvarious pairs of (c;c0)whenr= 0:1. It is clear that Transformer-XL has a longer RECL compared to\\nRNNs and other baselines because the relative gains are substantially larger.\\nFor reference, we plot the perplexities with varying context lengths in Figure 4. The y-axis denotes\\nthe “normal” perplexity (not calibrated by baselines).\\nD Attention Visualization\\nIn this section, we provide some visualization of the attention learned by the SoTA model on the\\nWikiText-103 validation set. Recall that, this model has 16 10-head transformer layers and relies on\\na memory of length 640.\\nFigure 5: Average attention over the previous 640 tokens, where each row corresponds to a attention head and each\\ncolumn corresponds to a relative location. There are totally 160 attention heads, and every 10 heads come from a\\nsingle layer. Darker colors indicate higher values.\\nThe ﬁrst visualization aims at revealing the overall trend of where the model is attending. Speciﬁcally,\\nfor each attention head of each layer, we average the attention distributions of all tokens in the validation\\nset. This is shown in Fig. 5. As we can see, the overall trend is to focus more on the nearby tokens\\nthan the faraway ones. However, it is also very clear that some attention heads have a wider attention\\ndistribution over the entire memory span, notably the head 8 from layer 1, head 78 from layer 8, and the\\nhead 158 from layer 16.\\nSince we are focused on learning long-range dependency, we are especially interested in these heads\\nwith a wider attention span. Thus, in the second set of visualization, we pick the three notable heads\\nmentioned above, and visualize their attention behavior for a randomly chosen position, as shown in Fig.\\n6. Here, we see three different patterns of wider attention:\\n\\x0fFor the head 8 in the 1st layer, we see an almost uniform attention over the entire memory span. This\\nis quite intuitive, as lower-level layers needs to screen the entire memory span to decide where to focus\\nfor higher-level layers(a) Head 8 from layer 1.\\n(b) Head 78 from layer 8.\\n(c) Head 158 from layer 16.\\nFigure 6: Visualization of the three heads with a wide attention range. Each row corresponds to a target loca-\\ntion/token and each column corresponds to a context location/token. Tokens in the memory that have top 20%\\nattention values are highlighted in red.\\n\\x0fFor the head 78 in the 8th layer (a middle-level layer), we see a very sparse attention pattern scattered\\nin all ranges of the memory. Again, this well ﬁts our intuition that as information accumulates, the\\nnetwork may focus on some particular position with special interests.\\n\\x0fFor the head 158 in the 16th layer (i.e. the last layer), each target location (corresponding to each row)\\nhas its own distinct sparse focus, differing from head 78 where target locations largely share the same\\nattentive location in memory. Meanwhile, the pattern is also different from the case of head 8, where\\na few locations are clearly attended more than others.\\nFinally, as we have discussed in section 3.3, the attention score can be decomposed into four intuitive\\nterms. Here, we want to further investigate how these four terms contribute to the overall attention trend\\nin Fig. 5. Since the term (c)represents the global content bias, i.e., the prior importance of each word\\nregardless of the context, we will leave it out and focus on the terms (a),(b)and(d). So, for each term,\\nwe take the Softmax w.r.t. the memory span and average the resulted distribution of all tokens in the\\nvalidation set. The results are visualized in Fig. 7:\\n\\x0fSince term (a)is fully content-based addressing, when averaging over all target words, the result is\\nessentially uniform over the entire context, except for a few very close words, which are likely to be\\nsemantically similar to the target word.\\n\\x0fThe overall trend of term (b)highly resembles that of the entire attention distribution in Fig. 5. It\\nsuggests that the global trend of focusing on the nearby context is largely contributed by this content-\\ndependent positional bias.\\n\\x0fThe overall trend of term (d)is also focusing more on nearby words. However, compared to the trend\\nof term (b), it is clearly ﬂatter and biases towards a longer context.(a) Term (a).\\n(b) Term (b).\\n(c) Term (d).\\nFigure 7: Visualization of the three terms in computing the attention score. Each row corresponds to a attention\\nhead and each column corresponds to a relative location.\\nE Generated Text\\nIn this section, we present some generated text from our best model trained the Wikitext-103 dataset.\\nWe seed the our Transformer-XL with a context of at most 512 consecutive tokens randomly sampled\\nfrom the test set of Wikitext-103. Then, we run Transformer-XL to generate a pre-deﬁned number of\\ntokens (500 or 1,000 in our case). For each generation step, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the top-40 probabilities of the\\nnext-step distribution and sample from top-40 tokens based on the re-normalized distribution.

On May 4, he had his worst start of his career\\nagainst the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger Stadium, throwing just 57 pitches in 11 / 3 innings, while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced — including the\\npitcher. He was booed loudly upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, \" I didn’t give our team any kind of chance. It’s just not a good\\nfeeling to let your teammates down, let everybody down. It stings, it hurts. I ’ve got to ﬁgure things out. \" Kershaw rebounded his next start by pitching an 8 inning\\ntwo-hitter and out-dueling the then undefeated Ubaldo Jiménez.

He produced his third career shutout on June 20, a two-hit, 11-strikeout effort against the Detroit Tigers. Kershaw became the ﬁrst Dodgers starter to strike\\nout the side in the 9th inning since Sandy Koufax’s perfect game. In his next start, on June 26, Kershaw pitched another complete game (against the Los Angeles\\nAngels of Anaheim ). He became the ﬁrst Dodger starter to have back-to-back complete game victories since Jeff Weaver in the 2005 season and the ﬁrst Dodger\\nto have double-digit strikeouts in consecutive starts since Chan-Ho Park in the 2000 season.

This victory marked the beginning of the\\nSecond Coalition. Napoleon’s rapid advance caused Austria – Russia, Britain\\nand Russia to make peace negotiations. The Russian army under Prince Mikhail\\nMikhailovich Mikhailovich Chaffee, commander of the Imperial Russian Army\\nin Switzerland, was able to drive off the Austrians in the Battle of Stockach\\n(1805) and to take Pressburg (modern Ö3 Austria) from the Austrians. At an\\nearly stage the Austro-Hungarian ﬂeet had been damaged in a storm off Cape\\nMatapan; this allowed the Allies to launch a full-scale invasion of Italy in Febru-\\nary 1805. The Battle of Austerlitz was the decisive French victory against\\nNapoleon and the largest naval battle in history, involving more modern-day\\nEuropean navies. The French military situation worsened as Napoleon faced\\nseveral threats related to his newly formed Army of Europe, particularly Russia\\nitself, which was now on the verge of collapse. The Russian general and friend\\nof Napoleon, Alexander, had been dissatisﬁed with the conduct of the Austri-\\nans; he was still in conﬂict with Emperor Napoleon, the French Republic’s king,\\nwho had declared war on Austria during the summer of 1804.

On 17 September 1805, the army marched from\\nBelluno towards Krems. By 29 September, they had reached Belluno and con-\\nducted its advance against a small Austrian force. By 31 September, the whole\\nforce had been reinforced by a brigade from the Army of Tyrol under the com-\\nmand of Pierre Augereau. The Austrians were now under the command of Mar-\\nshal Jean Victor Marie Moreau, a member of the Directory. Moreau had taken\\ncommand of the Austrian invasion force in the spring of 1805.

Af-\\nter three days, Charles’ army captured Lauenburg. The French forces pursued\\nthe Austrians to the Silesian border, where they encountered strong Austrian\\nresistance. These conﬂicts forced the Austrians to retreat into Tyrol and Aus-\\ntria agreed to a truce. The Austrian army, commanded by Wenzel Anton Karl,\\nCount of Merveldt, was reduced to around 10,000 men. It was initially planned\\nthat Archduke Charles would launch a counter-attack against the French army\\non the same day, as Napoleon had hoped, but this was not carried out. On 25\\nOctober, Merveldt left Styria for Tyrol. On the same day, Austria launched its\\nnew offensive against the French at Ulm. Charles withdrew his army from the\\nregion for a third time at the Battle of Elchingen, under the overall command of\\nthe Austrian generals, Ferdinand and Friedrich Wilhelm of Jülich-Cleves-Berg.\\nTo prevent Archduke Charles from escaping from the battleﬁeld, the comman-\\nder of the Habsburg army, Archduke Charles, planned to occupy the fortress\\nLinz; instead, he decided to force Franz von Hipper to surrender the city. How-\\never, as Charles moved to the south, Moreau arrived on the scene with additional\\nsoldiers – including the entire Imperial Guard – and defeated the Austrians at\\nthe Battle of Hohenlinden on 28 October. The loss of Linz resulted in Austria’s\\ncomplete defeat at Hohenlinden. In the meantime, the French Army of Obser-\\nvation and Preparedness was reorganized into the Army of the Danube under\\nFeldzeugmeister (Colonel-General) Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze. The army\\nwas composed of the I, IV , VI, VI, VII, VIII and IX Corps. With reinforcements\\nfrom Italy and France, it formed new battalions, companies, and squadrons in\\nthe Austrian army.

Mack bypassed Charles ’ methodical approach. Occurring\\nin the ﬁeld, Mack’s plan also undermined the overall command and organiza-\\ntional structure. Regardless, Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the\\nmilitary’s readiness. Furthermore, after misreading Napoleon’s maneuvers in\\nWürttemberg, Mack also reported to Vienna on the weakness of French dispo-\\nsitions. His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor, Francis II,\\nto enter the conﬂict against France, despite Charles ’ own advice to the con-\\ntrary. Responding to the report and rampant anti-French fever in Vienna, Fran-\\ncis dismissed Charles from his post as generalissimo and appointed his <unk>\\nbrother-in-law, Archduke Ferdinand, as commander. The inexperienced Ferdi-\\nnand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable Charles, having neither\\nmaturity nor aptitude for the assignment. Although Ferdinand retained nomi-\\nnal command, day-to-day decisions were placed in the hands of Mack, equally\\nill-suited for such an important assignment. When Mack was wounded early\\nin the campaign, he was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently,\\ncommand further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of\\nSchwarzenberg, an able cavalry ofﬁcer but inexperienced in the command of\\nsuch a large army.\\n= = = Road to Ulm = = =\\nThe campaign in the upper Danube valley began in October, with several clashes\\nin Swabia.

The French lost\\n1,500 men killed and wounded. Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles and\\n<unk> of the 15th and 17th Dragoons, Klenau’s force also captured 900 men,\\n11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons. Klenau’s victory was a singular success.\\nOn 14 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout\\nto the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed toward Elchingen to\\nsecure the bridge there, and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with\\nmost of the heavy artillery. Recognizing the opportunity, Marshal Michel Ney\\nhurried the rest of his VI Corps forward to re-establish contact with Dupont, who\\nwas still north of the Danube. In a two-pronged attack Ney sent one division to\\nthe south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube. This division began the\\nassault at Elchingen. At the same time another division crossed the river to the\\neast and moved west against Riesch’s position. After clearing Austrian pickets\\nfrom a bridge, the French attacked and captured a strategically located abbey atFrench approached Vienna, the Prussians had already surrendered. As the Aus-\\ntrians did not want to allow the war to continue, they decided to abandon their\\nterritories in the north and move their army to the north and west, cutting off\\nCharles from Vienna. The Battle of Warsaw was fought on 23 November 1805\\nbetween the French Army of the Danube and the Austrian Army of Styria in\\nthe vicinity of Warsaw and Pressburg (modern Trnava, Slovakia). At that time\\nHabsburg forcesthe top of the hill at bayonet point. The Austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to\\nfend off the French, but the Austrian infantry broke and ran.
